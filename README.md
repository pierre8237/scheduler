# scheduler
This project is a lightweight, single-page, workplace scheduler app. It uses moment.js running in the browser, as well as localStorage to keep track of the day's events with short notes.
The day and date are presented at the top of the page, with a tabulated area below to write and display any notes. The past, present and future are indicated with different background-color styling. Notes are saved by means of buttons appended to each row, and text can be deleted at any time. Local storage ensures reloading of the notes. Styling and proper reloading of the notes are made through the use of an array of ids, with each value representing the id of the cards. Id's correspond to the hour's indicated for each row, and a for in loop assigns the correct css selectors to the dom elements based on their relation to current hour and popultates the values from local storage based on the same.
